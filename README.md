# Bioinformatics & Machine Learning Project

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques in bioinformatics, with a focus on miRNA classification (or gene expression clustering). It is developed as part of the MSc Data Science coursework under the supervision of Professor Kevin Bryson.

## Project Objectives

- Download and preprocess biological data (from miRBase or GEO)
- Extract useful features from sequence or expression data
- Apply ML models to perform classification or clustering
- Evaluate model performance and interpret biological relevance

## Data Sources

- miRBase: https://www.mirbase.org/
- GEO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
